# Routers Service

By default **Aurora** comes with a router service. This service is using the `go_router` package for navigation. This service is using the `riverpod` package for state management. This service is using the `go_router_builder` dev package for type-safe navigation.

## app_router.dart

This file contains the `AppRouter` class. This class is responsible for providing the navigation service to the app. This class is using the `go_router` package for navigation.

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info">Here you will add routes for your app.</Callout>

Instead of using URL strings to navigate, I am using type-safe navigation in this app. For this I am using the `go_router_builder` dev package. This package is used to generate extended the `AppRouter` class.

Here is the `AppRouter` class with the `go_router_builder` annotations.

```dart filename="services/routers/app_router.dart"
part 'app_router.g.dart';

@TypedGoRoute<HomeRoute>(
  path: AppRouterPath.home,
  routes: <TypedGoRoute<GoRouteData>>[],
)
class HomeRoute extends GoRouteData {
  const HomeRoute();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) => const HomePage();
}

// Other routes

```

This file has a `part` file. This file is generated by the `flutter pub run build_runner build` command. This file is used to provide the localization service to the app.

## router_provider.dart

This file contains the `GoRouter` class. This class is responsible for providing the navigation service to the app. This class is using the `riverpod` package for state management.

```dart filename="services/routers/router_provider.dart"
part 'router_provider.g.dart';

@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)
// ignore: unsupported_provider_value
GoRouter router(RouterRef ref) {
  final key = GlobalKey<NavigatorState>(debugLabel: 'routerKey');

  return GoRouter(
      navigatorKey: key,
      debugLogDiagnostics: true,
      initialLocation: ref.watch(initialRouteProvider),
      routes: $appRoutes,
      errorBuilder: (c, s) => ErrorRoute(error: s.error!).build(c, s));
}
