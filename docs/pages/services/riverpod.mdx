# Riverpod Service

By default **Aurora** use the `riverpod` package for state management. But you can use any other state management package like `bloc`, `get_it` etc. This file is responsible for riverpod related services. Below is the tree structure of the `riverpod` folder.

```bash
 riverpod
 â”œâ”€â”€ extention
 â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ riverpod_extention.dart
 â”œâ”€â”€ helper
 â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ provider_helper.dart
 â””â”€â”€ riverpod.dart
```

## Extention

Here is we are adding some extention to the riverpod package. Only those extension add here that are releated to the riverpod package.

Some of extension example are:

- `ProviderHelperExtention` - This extension is responsible for adding a `formatHash` property to the `Ref` class. This property is used to format the hash of the provider. This is used to identify the provider in the logs.

```dart filename="services/riverpod/extention/riverpod_extention.dart"
extension ProviderHelperExtention on Ref {
  String get formatHash =>
      '0x${runtimeType.hashCode.toRadixString(32).padLeft(8, '0')}-${hashCode.toRadixString(23)}';
}
```

## Helper

Here you can add some helper classes or methods for the riverpod package.
This is the helper class for the riverpod package. This class is responsible for adding some helper methods to the riverpod package.

Some example of helper methods are:

- `ProviderHelper` - This class is responsible for adding some helper methods to the riverpod package.

```dart filename="services/riverpod/helper/provider_helper.dart"
import 'dart:developer' show log;

class ProviderHelper {
  static onInit(String name, String hash) {
    log(
      'initialized with hash: ${hash.toUpperCase()}',
      name: 'ðŸš€ $name',
      time: DateTime.now(),
    );
  }

  static onDispose(String name, String hash) {
    log(
      'disposed with hash: ${hash.toUpperCase()}',
      name: 'ðŸš® $name',
      time: DateTime.now(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Riverpod

Here I am adding the `riverpod.dart` file. This file is responsible for exporting all the files from the `extention` and `helper` folder.

```dart filename="services/riverpod/riverpod.dart"
export 'extention/riverpod_extention.dart';
export 'helper/provider_helper.dart';
```
