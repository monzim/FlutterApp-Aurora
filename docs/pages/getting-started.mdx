# Getting Started

Before you implement the architecture, you need to install **_mason_**. Cause it's the tool that will help you to generate the architecture files and folders.

### 🧑‍💻 Installing Mason CLI

You can install **_mason_** by running the following command:

```bash
# 🎯 Activate from https://pub.dev
dart pub global activate mason_cli
```

See more about **_mason_** [here](https://docs.brickhub.dev/).

## 🧱 Installing Aurora Brick

You can install **_Aurora Brick_** by running the following command:

```bash
# 🌐 Install globally
mason add -g app
```

## 📦 Initializing Aurora

Now create a new flutter project then navigate to the project directory and initialize the architecture by running the following command:

```bash
# Initialize the architecture
mason make app
```
