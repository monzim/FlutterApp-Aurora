# Localization Service

By default **Aurora** comes with internationalization support. This service is responsible for providing the localization service to the app. This service is using the `riverpod` package for state management.

Here I am using the `intl` package for localization. This package is used to generate the localization files from the `arb` files.

```bash
├── localization
│   ├── arb
│   │   ├── app_bn.arb
│   │   └── app_en.arb
│   ├── extention
│   │   └── locale_extention.dart
│   └── providers
│       ├── localization_provider.dart
│       └── localization_provider.g.dart
|-- l10n.yaml
```

## Localization yaml

Flutter need a `l10n.yaml` file to generate the localization files. This file is responsible for generating the localization files from the `arb` files.

```yaml filename="l10n.yaml"
arb-dir: lib/services/localization/arb
template-arb-file: app_en.arb
output-localization-file: app_localizations.dart
nullable-getter: false
```

## Arb

By default **Aurora** supports two languages `English` and `Bangla`. You can add more languages by adding the `arb` files in the `arb` folder.

In this folder I am adding the `arb` files. This folder contains the `arb` files. This files are used to generate the localization files. This folder refence to the `l10n.yaml` file.

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Tabs items={["app_bn.arb", "app_en.arb"]}>
  <Tab>
```arb filename="services/localization/arb/app_bn.arb"
{
  "appTitle": "ফ্লাটার অরোরা",
}
```
</Tab>

  <Tab>
```arb filename="services/localization/arb/app_en.arb"
{
  "appTitle": "Flutter Aurora",
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Extention

Here I am adding the `locale_extention.dart` file. This file is used to add the `l10n` extention to the `BuildContext`. This extention is used to get the localization files from the `BuildContext`.

```dart filename="services/localization/extention/locale_extention.dart"
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';

extension LocalizedBuildContext on BuildContext {
  AppLocalizations get l10n => AppLocalizations.of(this);
}
```

## Providers

Here I am adding the `localization_provider.dart` file. This file is used to provide the localization service to the app. This file is using the `riverpod` package for state management.

```dart filename="services/localization/providers/localization_provider.dart"
part 'localization_provider.g.dart';

@riverpod
Locale? appLocalizationService(AppLocalizationServiceRef ref) {
  final appSettings = ref.watch(appSettingsProvider);

  final k =
      appSettings.whenData((value) => AppLocales.getLocale(value.language));

  return k.value;
}
```

This file has a `part` file. This file is generated by the `flutter pub run build_runner build` command. This file is used to provide the localization service to the app.

```dart filename="services/localization/providers/localization_provider.g.dart"
